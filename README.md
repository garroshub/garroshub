### 🎤 Conference Presentations

#### Digital Strategies in Wildfire Management: The Advantage of Applying Social Media Analytics and Web 3.0 Integration
*Presented at the 2024 INFORMS Telecommunications and Network Analytics Conference, Dallas, TX*
> Highlights the economic value of accelerating response times through targeted SMA metrics, advocating for their integration into existing frameworks to improve forecasting accuracy and mitigate loss.

### 📖 Working Papers

#### Who Reacts to Dividend Income Changes? Causal Evidence of Heterogeneous Investor Responses and Behavioral Biases
*Under Peer Review at Journal of Financial Economics, March 2025*
> We provide causal evidence that retail investors respond more sharply to dividend tax changes than institutions. The results suggest these responses are driven by behavioral frictions like income salience and mental accounting rather than just standard incentives.

#### When Do Budgetary Shocks Backfire? Federal-State Funding Gaps in Wildfire Preparedness
*Under Peer Review at Production and Operations Management, January 2025*
> Investigates whether budget boosts improve wildfire preparedness. We find that while positive shocks enhance short-term accuracy, they lead to inefficiencies and volatility over multiple budget cycles, supporting Post-Keynesian fiscal perspectives.

#### Sustainable Wildfire Management Meets Social Media: How Virtual Interaction Affects Wildfire Response Costs
*Revise & Resubmit (Major Revision), Production and Operations Management, November 2024*
> Uses a temporal gravity score model to show that social media visibility correlates with greater resource deployment. While the direct effect on unit costs is ambiguous, social signals clearly influence allocation decisions.

### 🚧 Research in Process

#### Corporate Transfer Pricing and Tax Policy Design: A Bayesian Stackelberg Structural Model
*Started January 2025*
> Developing a structural Bayesian model to examine government-firm interactions, estimating tax rate elasticities and simulating policy outcomes under global minimum tax scenarios.
