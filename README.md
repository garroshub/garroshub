#### Who Reacts to Dividend Income Changes? Causal Evidence of Heterogeneous Investor Responses and Behavioral Biases
- **Status**: Under review at *Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance* (March 2025)
- **Abstract**: Provides causal evidence that retail investors respond more sharply to dividend tax changes than institutions, driven by behavioral frictions like income salience and mental accounting rather than just standard incentives.

#### When Do Budgetary Shocks Backfire? Federal-State Funding Gaps in Wildfire Preparedness
- **Status**: Under review at *Journal of Policy Analysis and Management* (January 2025)
- **Abstract**: Investigates the temporal relationship between federal budget changes and state-level wildfire preparedness accuracy across budget cycles.
- **Keywords**: Intergovernmental relations, public budgeting, green fiscal policy, emergency management, policy implementation

#### Sustainable Wildfire Management Meets Social Media: How Virtual Interaction Affects Wildfire Response Costs
- **Status**: Under review at *Production and Operations Management* (November 2024)
- **Abstract**: Uses a temporal gravity score model to show that social media visibility correlates with greater resource deployment. While the direct effect on unit costs is ambiguous, social signals influence allocation decisions.
- **Keywords**: Wildfire economics, social media analytics, California wildfires
