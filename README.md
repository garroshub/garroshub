#### Who Reacts to Dividend Income Changes? Causal Evidence of Heterogeneous Investor Responses and Behavioral Biases
- **Status**: Under Peer Review at Journal of Financial Economics (March 2025)
- **Abstract**: Provides causal evidence that retail investors respond more sharply to dividend tax changes than institutions, driven by behavioral frictions like income salience and mental accounting rather than just standard incentives.

#### [When Do Budgetary Shocks Backfire? Federal-State Funding Gaps in Wildfire Preparedness](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941995)
- **Status**: Under Peer Review at Production and Operations Management (January 2025)
- **Abstract**: Investigates federal wildfire budget allocations, finding that while positive budgetary shocks initially enhance decision accuracy, their effects diminish and grow volatile over the long term, supporting Post-Keynesian fiscal perspectives.
- **Keywords**: Post-Keynesian, Sustainable Budget Plan, Green Fiscal Policy, Social Media Strategy

#### [Sustainable Wildfire Management Meets Social Media: How Virtual Interaction Affects Wildfire Response Costs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941977)
- **Status**: Revise & Resubmit (Major Revision), Production and Operations Management (November 2024)
- **Abstract**: Uses a temporal gravity score model to show that social media visibility correlates with greater resource deployment. While the direct effect on unit costs is ambiguous, social signals clearly influence allocation decisions.
- **Keywords**: Wildfire Economics, Social Media Analytics, California Wildfires
